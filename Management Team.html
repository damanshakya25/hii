                            No institution in the world has ever succeeded without soul. The soul of an institution is its academic ambience; the competence of faculty and the systems through which the academic programmer is delivered. The soul of an institution can neither be seen nor is it visible, but in can be felt and experienced. I invite you to experience this soul and participate in learning methodology adopted by LMPS and secure a future direction in your life.

                            Many people consider education as a medium of getting good jobs, living a royal life, earning money and much more. But education doesn't really mean this. Real meaning comes when one's way of thinking gets changed and one starts thinking for the betterment of the society, country and world at large. On the whole education means holistic development of a child not only restricted to the achievements of academics but also helping the child to come up with those inherited knowledge to build a better tomorrow, with a disciplined way of life. 
                        </p><br>

                            At Lord Mother Public School, believe that every child is a gift of God, and that excellence is the way of life. Keeping this in mind we provide the students value based education, opportunities to grow in every sphere of life both in academics and in their personality development. In the field of co-curricular activities, games and sports our students are paving theirway towards great heights

                            Physical Education helps in developing students’ competence and confidence. It helps them to take part in a wide range of physical activities that are crucial to their lives— both in and out of school. As a Physical Education Tearcher, I found that games support the development of wide range of skills essential to the autonomous learner 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            The first benefit of physical education is that it teaches ethical traits that students need to thrive in this competitive world. The main ethics that they learn from physical education are perseverance and work ethics. Whether in physical education or sports, disputes often arise and only ethics and perseverance from the players can reduce the disputes.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>
                            Physical fitness is the key ingredient for a healthy lifestyle. This is why physical education is an important element in most schools. When students have regular fitness activities as part of their daily regimen, they stay fit and healthy. Regular physical activities daily help in better absorption of nutrients in the body and also helps in improving cardiovascular health and developing muscular strength

                        One of the advantages of physical education is that it helps in improving the academic performance of the students. Most physical activities that students do in schools are related to higher levels of concentration which in turn help with better behaviors. Physical activities and sports activities help in boosting the knowledge learned in the classroom.

                    <p>
                        Keeping all these things in view, we try to encourage every student in our school to take part in physical activities.

                            An examination system evaluates factual understanding, conceptual understanding and global understanding of prescribed syllabus and designed curriculum. Examination system assesses individual's capability to interpret learning of his own language. It is not merely test of knowledge. Examination system evaluates presistant and consistent quality of an individual. It tests the attitude of an individual i.e. how does an individual perform better in extreme pressure

                            Exams are very important for children. Not just because they pass it and they will be promoted to the next class, but because in school they learn that something like an exam is like that and how is it handled. Instead of cheating in the exam without taking any pressure as a burden, If we can provide a good environment by motivating them, then only they will be able to face every difficulty with courage in their coming tomorrow.

                            In this 21st century today where the world is running with its huge technological advancements, we still have prevalent problems for women inequality in social, economical, political sphere. Therefore there is a need of women welfare which will empower women to have their own dignity in society. This is an excerpt which forcuses especially in Indian context

                            Being a woman and also being the head of women welfare society of Lord Mother Public School. I always understand that welfare of women can be possible by the very basic and necessary acts of providing them education. then comes the other way of creating awareness of different laws and rights available to them. Awareness can be created by organizing campus in rural areas. And the most prevalent and best way is the internet. Through teaching the way of finding information online a lot of problem can be solved.

                            There are different crimes being committed against womens. If a women has stepped out to her permitted boundaries it is considered to be a sin. There are one half of women which have stepped out by overcoming all the barriers and are doing well in there respective fields but the other half is still in that position restricted, not motivated and let the things go on as it has been according to the old illogical traditional practices.
